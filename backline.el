;;; Commentary:

;; An outline heading does not extend to the right edge of the window
;; when its body is collapsed.  This is unfortunate when the used face
;; sets the background color or another property that is visible on
;; whitespace.  This package adds overlays to extend the appearance of
;; headings all the way to the right window edge.

;;   (use-package backline
;;     :after outline
;;     :config (advice-add 'outline-flag-region :after 'backline-update))

;; This package should be used together with the `outline-minor-faces'
;; package.  Instead setting the built-in `outline-minor-mode-highlight' to
;; `append' also works, but then top-level s-expressions are highlighted as
;; if they were sections, which makes the overview less readable.
