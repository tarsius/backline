;;; Commentary:

;; An outline heading does not extend to the right edge of the window
;; when its body is collapsed.  This is unfortunate when the used face
;; sets the background color or another property that is visible on
;; whitespace.  This package adds overlays to extend the appearance of
;; headings all the way to the right window edge.

;;   (use-package backline
;;     :after outline
;;     :config (advice-add 'outline-flag-region :after 'backline-update))

;; The above advice requires that `outline-minor-faces-mode' (from the
;; `outline-minor-faces' package) is enabled.

;;   (use-package outline-minor-faces
;;     :after outline
;;     :config (add-hook 'outline-minor-mode-hook
;;                       #'outline-minor-faces-mode))

;; Do NOT set `outline-minor-mode-highlight' (provided by `outline' since
;; Emacs 28.1) to a non-nil value, because that is incompatible with this
;; package and `outline-minor-faces' (which is an older and still superior
;; alternative).  See `outline-minor-faces' for details.
